I expected to be able to quickly list a few, but instead, I've found it challenging. Any goals that sprung to mind seemed vague and aspirational. Some worthwhile goals of public education are producing:

   - global society (?)
3. Individuals who can contribute economically
4. Lifelong learners who can adapt to changing economic trends

Strongly related to the goals of public education are what outcomes we want to see. This seems like an easier task. While goals seem lofty, outcomes are tied to metrics.
