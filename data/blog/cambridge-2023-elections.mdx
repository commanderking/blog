### Explaining Ranked Choice Voting through 2023 Cambridge City Council Elections

Since 1941, Cambridge, MA has used ranked choice voting to elect its city council and school committee members.
The process can be daunting to newcomers with a more convoluted [ballot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wxHv6vzkclASTKdY1Qgl9CFfO1qREcy7/view), and additional steps required when tallying the final votes for each candidate, such as determining the quota and transferring the surplus.

To explain the complexities with the system, let's examine how the 2023 Cambridge school council members were elected. For the 2023 election,

- 23,512 ballots were processed.
- 173 were invalid (less than 1% of voters)
- 23,339 were valid

Cambridge uses a [Droop quota system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droop_quota) where candidates are elected once they reach the quota. Any remaining ballots are reallocated to the voter's next choice.

- The quota for 2023 was: 23,339 / 7, or 2334 votes.

Once any candidate reaches 2334 votes, they are elected. Now let's see how the ballots were counted.
