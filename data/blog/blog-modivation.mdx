## Searching for something

It's too late for a quarterlife crisis, too early for a midlife one, and there doesn't seem to be a catchy way to describe a crisis in your mid-30s. Crisis is too strong of a word. Perhaps "lost" or "directionless" are more appropriate. When I taught high school students in my 20s, I never questioned my impact on students. As I transitioned into graduate school, I committed to designing educational software based on what I learned from teaching. And when I eventually transitioned into the world of software engineering, I found joy in rapidly learning a new skillset in an entirely new profession. Both teaching and engineering were challening careers where I immersed myself deeply in the work, and felt fulfilled by it.

In 2022, perhaps exacerbated by the pandemic, I needed a breath of fresh air. I started questioning whether I was doing the right things. I wondered about all the paths I didn't take and haven't taken. I took a break from my career.

During my break, I read more books in on year than I had in the previous ten. I traveled around Spain, biked through the Netherlands, took on a research project in Kenya, and finally moved to Taiwan, where I spent so many of my childhood summers, and where I currently live.

Since then, I've taken up contracting work to develop a more balanced lifestyle. I still find myself searching, however, and also paralyzed by the many opportunities I _could_ pursue.

I've started so many small projects, most of them technical, but none of them completed. I've continued to learn, but not at the pace when I first started teaching or programming. I hope writing this blog won't be another small project that goes unfinished.

## Overcoming the Hesitation

Even as someone who has worked in the education field my entire career, I find it difficult to navigate discussions in the field, and even more challenging to enter the conversation. Just determing the questions that matter is challenging because there is so much discussion at all levels, from the high-up policy level to the nitty-gritty of classroom instruction.

I also hesitate to participate because I'm only slowly beginning to consistently read education related pieces. To express an opinion on topics where many professionals are more experienced and writers are more informed seems premature and misleading.

I naturally lean towards thinking that most policies have tradeoffs. When reading through education articles, I'm often shocked by the authors' conviction. Where they see definitive science, I often see specific contexts where an approach was effective. Where many can jump in and advocate for what worked for them and their community, I see challenges to scaling such an approach for all. I nonetheless admire their willingness to take a stance that may be torched. It's easy to point out pros and cons from the sidelines.

Given my concern with a lack of knowedge and my inclination to not expression an opinion, I'm writing to overcome both. I write not because I have a solution, but because I'm trying to figure it all out, and writing is a way to quickly iterate through my thoughts.

## Track Record of Thoughts

I'm also excited that by writing, I'll have a record of how my thoughts have changed over time.

## Power and Influence

Outline:

1. Searching for something meaningful at this stage of my life
1. Enjoy reading about education and thinking about it, but find it so hard to navigate
1. I'd like to have an opinion
1. Power and Influence - having a voice. The Power Broker
1. It's where I've started my career and perhaps the line where I can have the most impact
1. A track record of where I was, and where I'm going. I'm not trying to be right.
1. Trying something new and truly difficult
