Hey there, Jeff here! ðŸ‘‹

I mostly write about education, but occassionally dabble in other topics like urban planning and tea.

I taught high school Chemistry and Chinese at a [NJ public school](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/schoolsearch/school_detail.asp?Search=1&DistrictID=3402670&ID=340267001412), serving students from Camden.

I'm currently a software engineer working at Curriculum Associates.
